These are the course notes for a half-day introduction to R, given by the [Monash Bioinformatics Platform](http://bioinformatics.erc.monash.edu) as part of Monash University's [Data Fluency](https://www.monash.edu/library/data-fluency) initiative.

R is both a programming language and an interactive environment for doing data science. Today we will be concentrating on R as an *interactive environment*. This will be just a small taste of R, after today there will still be much to learn about R as a programming language and as an environment for data science.

We will be using RStudio, a friendly front end to R. On the day, we will be using RStudio from the web, but you can also install R and RStudio on your laptop. Both R and RStudio are free.

## Further resources

Workshops run by the Monash Bioinformatics Platform:

* [A full-day introduction to R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-intro-2/), also covering topics such as missing data, factors, and merging data frames.
* [A further workshop on R](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/r-more/), covering programming, the modern Tidyverse approach, Bioconductor for biological data, Rmarkdown for writing up results, and Shiny for web-apps.

Other resources:

* [The R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great introduction to modern R usage.

* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) offer workshops on using computers effectively for science, with all course notes free online. For example, [this Data Carpentry workshop on R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/).
